Version 2.5

Installation:
Upload user_otp directory under the 'apps' directory of your ownCloud.
user_otp folder should have read write permission for the web server user (under debian/ubutnu : chown -R www-data:www-data user_otp)
Navigate to the 'Apps' page in Admin.
Click on 'user_otp' in the application list. Then click the 'Enable' button.

Usage:
- Navigate to the 'Admin' page to set the server encryption key;
- Click 'Save';
- Navigate to 'Personal' page to create Your OTP

- keep an admin user working without otp in case of a lost of otp seed
  if not you can delete otp user config in the db with the query
  "delete from *PREFIX*user_otp where `user` = 'YOURUSERLOGIN'
  replace *PREFIX* by owncloud table prefix 'oc_' by default

- Use the navigation entry "OTP users" (on left bar, with admin account) 
  to manage user's OTP
- if you want to be able to send email to users with OTP config 
  your server must be correctly configure : 
  http://doc.owncloud.org/server/6.0/admin_manual/configuration/configuration_mail.html
 
  
Todo:
- improve Admin interface to manage otp user information (mass provisionning / ...)
- add user rescue otp code as lost password process
